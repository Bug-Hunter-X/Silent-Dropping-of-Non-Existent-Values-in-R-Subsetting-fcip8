# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector that contains some values not present in the data frame's column.

data <- data.frame(col1 = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), col2 = 1:4)

subset <- data[data$col1 %in% c("A", "B", "E"), ]

# The result will be only rows where col1 is "A" or "B". Rows with "E" are dropped silently.
# No error is thrown but some rows may be unexpectedly missing.
