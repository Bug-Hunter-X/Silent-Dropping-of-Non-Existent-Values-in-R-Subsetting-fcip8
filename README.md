This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R when subsetting data frames using the `%in%` operator with character vectors.  The issue arises when the character vector contains values not present in the data frame's column.  R silently drops these values, leading to potential data loss and unexpected results without any error message.  The `bug.r` file shows this error, while `bugSolution.r` offers a solution.
